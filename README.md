# Saliency_SR

We provide prototype code of our paper "Move Structure Recognition in Scientific Papers with Saliency Attribution".

The code structures are:

1) `sentence_label_train.py` contains code for training a sentence-level move classifier; 

2) `salient_evluation.py` contains code for using the sentence-level classifier for move saliency attribution.

3) `sentence_label_train_strong.py` contains code for training saliency enhanced move structure recognition models.
