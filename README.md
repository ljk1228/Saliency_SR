# Scientific Abstract Moves Dataset (SAMD)

## Overview
The Scientific Abstract Moves Dataset (SAMD) is a manually annotated dataset specifically created for the study of scientific abstract moves. It contains annotated abstracts from conference papers in the NLP domain, including ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL conferences, which are included in the ACL Anthology.

## Dataset Details
- Total number of abstracts: 1,500
- Total number of sentences: 8,934

## Corpus Selection
The corpus for this dataset was carefully selected from abstracts of conference papers in the field of NLP. The abstracts were sourced from reputable conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL, all of which are included in the ACL Anthology.

## Annotation Process
The annotation of the dataset involved manual identification and labeling of scientific abstract moves. Annotators were provided with clear guidelines and instructions for identifying and labeling moves in the abstracts. The annotation was performed by domain experts with a strong understanding of NLP research and scientific writing conventions.

## Annotation Schema
The dataset is annotated with the following scientific abstract moves:
1. Background: Providing the background and context of the research.
2. Objective: Stating the objective or research question of the study.
3. Method: Describing the methodology or approach used in the research.
4. Results: Presenting the results or findings of the study.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing the main conclusions or implications of the research.

## Data Format
The dataset is provided in a tabular format, with each row representing a sentence from the abstracts. The following columns are included:
- Sentence: The original sentence from the abstract.
- Label: The annotated move label for the sentence (Background, Objective, Method, Results, or Conclusion).

## Dataset Usage
This dataset can be used for various research tasks related to scientific abstract analysis, discourse analysis, and move classification. It provides valuable insights into the structure and organization of scientific abstracts in the NLP domain.
