# Scientific Abstract Moves Dataset

## Overview
The Scientific Abstract Moves Dataset (SAMD) is a manually annotated dataset specifically created for the study of scientific abstract moves. It contains annotated abstracts from conference papers in the NLP domain, including ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL conferences, which are included in the ACL Anthology.

## Dataset Details
- Total number of abstracts: 1,500
- Total number of sentences: 8,934

## Corpus Selection
The corpus for this dataset was carefully selected from abstracts of conference papers in the field of NLP. The abstracts were sourced from reputable conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL, all of which are included in the ACL Anthology.

## Annotation Process
The manual annotation process strictly followed the move analysis method, which is the most influential language use analysis method in the ESP (English for Specific Purposes) field. The sentence was taken as the smallest annotation unit. A combination of top-down and bottom-up annotation methods was employed to determine the move label of each sentence. The annotation was conducted by six professional annotators from the School of Foreign Languages. The inter-annotator agreement was measured using the Kappa coefficient, which was calculated to be 0.785, indicating a substantial agreement among the six annotators. This level of agreement is equivalent to about 93.375% of the corpus being independently annotated in a consistent manner.

## Annotation Schema
The dataset is annotated based on an eight-step structure annotation scheme, which includes the following moves:
1. Background: Providing the background and context of the research.
2. GAP: Addressing the research gap or problem statement.
3. Method: Describing the methodology or approach used in the research.
4. Purpose: Stating the objective or research question of the study.
5. Result: Presenting the results or findings of the study.
6. Conclusion: Summarizing the main conclusions of the research.
7. Contribution: Describing the contribution of the research.
8. Implication: Discussing the implications or potential applications of the research.

## Data Format
The dataset is provided in a tabular format, with each row representing a sentence from the abstracts. The following columns are included:
- Sentence: The original sentence from the abstract.
- Label: The annotated move label for the sentence (Background, GAP, Method, Purpose, Result, Conclusion, Contribution, or Implication).

## Dataset Usage
This dataset can be used for various research tasks related to scientific abstract analysis, move analysis, and discourse analysis. It provides valuable insights into the structure and organization of scientific abstracts in the NLP domain.
